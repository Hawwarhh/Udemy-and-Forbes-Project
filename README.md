1. Udemy Project
Problem: Udemy noticed a decline in course revenue from 2011-2017, and the reason was unknown.
The goal was to analyze course registration data to identify revenue trends and recommend actions to improve future earnings.

Tools Used:

Google Sheets: For data cleaning, organizing, and analysis.
Tableau: For data visualization, making trends easier to interpret.
Key Insights:

Web Development was the most subscribed subject, with 7 million subscribers (68% of total subscriptions).
The highest price per subject was in Web Development, particularly at the intermediate level, at $85.
Revenue declined in 2017 due to fewer free beginner courses and reduced course ratings, leading to fewer subscribers.
Recommendations:

Increase the number of free courses, especially for beginners.
Slightly increase the prices of all subjects except Musical Instruments, which had the fewest subscribers.


2. Forbes Project
Problem: This project analyzed the top 2000 businesses listed by Forbes from 2017-2021 to gauge the impact of COVID-19 on global businesses and economies, with a focus on sales, profits, and market value.

Tools Used:

SQL: For querying and managing the large datasets.
Google Sheets: For merging and cleaning the data.
Tableau: For visualizing trends and insights.
Key Insights:

Sales significantly increased post-COVID, with the highest total sales in 2021 ($867 billion).
The United States reported the highest positive profit impact post-COVID, largely driven by e-commerce and digital transformation.
China had higher company assets, particularly through businesses like ICC and ICBC.
Conclusion: The post-COVID era had a positive impact on global businesses, especially in the U.S., where digital adoption and e-commerce growth led to increased sales and profits.
